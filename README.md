## OCPP Versions

### 1.6S (SOAP)

OCPP 1.6S (SOAP) is an early version of the Open Charge Point Protocol that utilizes the SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) for communication between EV chargers and central systems. It was designed to enable interoperability between different charging stations and networks, focusing on stability and security in data exchanges. [OCPP 1.6 Specification (SOAP)](https://www.openchargealliance.org/protocols/ocpp-16/).

### 1.6J (JSON)

OCPP 1.6J (JSON) is a variant of the OCPP 1.6 specification that replaces SOAP with JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) for lighter, more efficient data handling. This version provides the same core functionality as 1.6S but with faster communication, making it suitable for more modern applications. [OCPP 1.6 Specification (JSON)](https://www.openchargealliance.org/protocols/ocpp-16/).

### 2.0

OCPP 2.0 introduced significant improvements over previous versions, including support for more advanced use cases, enhanced security features, and better device management. It also brought new functionalities like improved transaction handling and customizable charging profiles, making it a more robust protocol for complex charging networks. [OCPP 2.0 Specification](https://www.openchargealliance.org/protocols/ocpp-20/).

### 2.0.1

OCPP 2.0.1 is an update to OCPP 2.0, addressing minor corrections and improvements while maintaining backward compatibility. It refines existing features and adds clarity to the protocol specifications, enhancing communication reliability between charge points and central systems. [OCPP 2.0.1 Specification](https://www.openchargealliance.org/protocols/ocpp-201/).

### 2.1

OCPP 2.1 is the latest version of the protocol, further expanding on the capabilities introduced in OCPP 2.0.1. This version includes additional security measures, refined device management, and support for new functionalities such as ISO 15118 integration, making it suitable for the evolving EV charging ecosystem. [OCPP 2.1 Specification](https://www.openchargealliance.org/protocols/ocpp-21/).
